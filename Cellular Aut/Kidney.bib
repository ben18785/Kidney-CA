abstract = {While the genetic control of renal branching morphogenesis has been extensively described, the cellular basis of this process remains obscure. GDNF/RET signaling is required for ureter and kidney development, and cells lacking Ret are excluded from the tips of the branching ureteric bud in chimeric kidneys. Here, we find that this exclusion results from earlier Ret-dependent cell rearrangements in the caudal Wolffian duct, which generate a specialized epithelial domain that later emerges as the tip of the primary ureteric bud. By juxtaposing cells with elevated or reduced RET activity, we find that Wolffian duct cells compete, based on RET signaling levels, to contribute to this domain. At the same time, the caudal Wolffian duct transiently converts from a simple to a pseudostratified epithelium, a process that does not require Ret. Thus, both Ret-dependent cell movements and Ret-independent changes in the Wolffian duct epithelium contribute to ureteric bud formation.},

@article{Meyer2004,
abstract = {In search of guiding principles involved in the branching of epithelial tubes in the developing kidney, we analyzed branching of the ureteric bud (UB) in whole kidney culture as well as in isolated UB culture independent of mesenchyme but in the presence of mesenchymally derived soluble factors. Microinjection of the UB lumen (both in the isolated UB and in the whole kidney) with fluorescently labeled dextran sulfate demonstrated that branching occurred via smooth tubular epithelial outpouches with a lumen continuous with that of the original structure. Epithelial cells within these outpouches cells were wedge-shaped with actin, myosin-2 and ezrin localized to the luminal side, raising the possibility of a "purse-string" mechanism. Electron microscopy and decoration of heparan sulfates with biotinylated FGF2 revealed that the basolateral surface of the cells remained intact, without the type of cytoplasmic extensions (invadopodia) that are seen in three-dimensional MDCK, mIMCD, and UB cell culture models of branching tubulogenesis. Several growth factor receptors (i.e., FGFR1, FGFR2, c-Ret) and metalloproteases (i.e., MT1-MMP) were localized toward branching UB tips. A large survey of markers revealed the ER chaperone BiP to be highly expressed at UB tips, which, by electron microscopy, are enriched in rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, supporting high activity in the synthesis of transmembrane and secretory proteins at UB tips. After early diffuse proliferation, proliferating and mitotic cells were mostly found within the branching ampullae, whereas apoptotic cells were mostly found in stalks. Gene array experiments, together with protein expression analysis by immunoblotting, revealed a differential spatiotemporal distribution of several proteins associated with epithelial maturation and polarization, including intercellular junctional proteins (e.g., ZO-1, claudin-3, E-cadherin) and the subapical cytoskeletal/microvillar protein ezrin. In addition, Ksp-cadherin was found at UB ampullary cells next to developing outpouches, suggesting a role in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. These data from the isolated UB culture system support a model where UB branching occurs through outpouching possibly mediated by wedge-shaped cells created through an apical cytoskeletal purse-string mechanism. Additional potential mechanisms include (1) differential localization of growth factor receptors and metalloproteases at tips relative to stalks; (2) creation of a secretory epithelium, in part manifested by increased expression of the ER chaperone BiP, at tips relative to stalks; (3) after initial diffuse proliferation, coexistence of a balance of proliferation vs. apoptosis favoring tip growth with a very different balance in elongating stalks; and (4) differential maturation of the tight and adherens junctions as the structures develop. Because, without mesenchyme, both lateral and bifid branching occurs (including the ureter), the mesenchyme probably restricts lateral branching and provides guidance cues in vivo for directional branching and elongation as well as functioning to modulate tubular caliber and induce differentiation. Selective cadherin, claudin, and microvillar protein expression as the UB matures likely enables the formation of a tight, polarized differentiated epithelium. Although, in vivo, metanephric mesenchyme development occurs simultaneously with UB branching, these studies shed light on how (mesenchymally derived) soluble factors alone regulate spatial and temporal expression of morphogenetic molecules and processes (proliferation, apoptosis, etc.) postulated to be essential to the UB branching program as it forms an arborized structure with a continuous lumen.},

@article{Miura2002,
abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the interaction of positive and inhibitory signals plays a crucial role during lung branching morphogenesis. We found that in mesenchyme-free conditions, the lung epithelium exerted a lateral inhibitory effect on the neighbouring epithelium via depletion of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). Contrary to previous suggestions, bone morphogenetic protein 4 could not substitute for the inhibitory effect. Based on of this observation, we used a reaction-diffusion model of the substrate-depletion type to represent the initial phase of in vitro branching morphogenesis of lung epithelium, with depletion of FGF playing the role of lateral inhibitor. The model was able to account for the effects of the FGF1 concentration, extracellular matrix degradation and different subtypes of FGF on morphogenesis of the lung bud epithelia. These results suggest that the depletion of FGF may be a key regulatory component in initial phase of branching morphogenesis of the lung bud epithelium in vitro.},

@article{Lehtonen1975,
abstract = {Transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the epithelio-mesenchymal interface between the interacting mouse ureter-bud and the metanephric mesenchyme. The gap between the epithelial and mesenchymal cells varied in width. At the stalk of the ureter-bud the interspace was often about 1 mum, but in the inductively active areas at the tips of the branching ureter-bud epithelio-mesenchymal contacts were seen through discontinuities in the basal lamina. At these points the gap between the interacting cells was often less than 20 nm, in places less than 10 nm. The amount of electron-dense, ruthenium-red-positive material was greatest at the stalk of the ureter-bud, but only a small amount of extracellular material was found between the interacting cells at the tips. Whether epithelio-mesenchymal cell contacts play a role in kidney tubule induction is not yet known, but their existence in the inductively active areas and their absence in inactive zones suggests that they are morphogenetically significant. The finding also obviates the need to postulate long-range transmission of inductive signals to explain this example of embryonic induction.},
